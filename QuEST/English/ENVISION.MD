# QuEST Envision

## Our definition of "Framework"

* Something that makes decisions in my place
* A collection of codified assumptions
* A library that invokes your code and gives to you a structure
* A collection of tools and patterns, useful to solve known problems
* Precooked solutions
* Codified Knowledge and experience
* A convention
* A solution that solves most problems
* A "Frame" used to work, in which some trade-offs have been evaluated
* A system that defines a structure  on which it is possible to build

## Scope

Frameworks for Developing software

## Value

* The value brought by the software
* Related to the lifecycle --> For the users
* Meet the needs in time

## What is the objective of the Manifesto?

* Facilitate the work
* Distil Conversations
* Generate Awareness

## Principles

* Have clear ideas on what to do (Functional requirements VS Non-functional requirements)
* "No Framework" is always an option
* Always evaluate the cost of a Framework
* Always evaluate the exit cost for every single feature of a Framework
* The Framework has to be Sacrificial
* Learn the principles behind a Framework
* Evaluate if the team has the skill to work without A Framework
*  Question the Framework's way
* Prefer non-monolithic Frameworks
* Technical choices, made by technical people collaborating with stakeholders
* The code of the Framework that you choose, is still your code
* Frameworks are a source of knowledge
* Frameworks as entry points (lower the cognitive load for junior developers)
* Every project has its characteristics and needs
* The value of a software is not the code itself but in the reasons behind the existence of that code.
* Do what needs to be done
* The decision-making criteria that led to the choice of a framework should be known to all the members in the team
* Define a convention and motivate it
* Don't be lazy
* Frameworkless !== Hate Frameworks
* Soon !== Hurry
* Courage (that emerges from the awareness)
* Every solution can be valid or not in a specific context
* Don't assume anything (Brain Driven Development)
* Walking Skeleton
* Simple Design (Evolutionary, Emergent)
* Work on "The Metal"
* Knowledge of Fundamentals
* Be aware of the decisions that you are delegating
* Training Skills with Katas
* Engineering is the art of trade-off
* Look for examples of solutions in Frameworks
* Generate Options, postpone revocable decisions
* Question what you think you understand
* Be careful of Buzzwords
* Be respectful to who write Frameworks
* Consider the cost of delay
* Recognize the value of a Framework
* No Silver Bullet (even this Manifesto)
* Frameworkless as an approach and not as a rejection
* Be prepared to the failure of the Framework
* Ask yourself if a decision made in the past is still the right one
* Document and irradiate your decisions
* Knowledge of Frameworks is a defence mechanism
