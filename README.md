The Frameworkless Movement is a group of developers interested in developing applications without frameworks. We don't hate frameworks, nor we will ever create campaigns against frameworks, but we perceive the **misuse of frameworks as a lack of knowledge regarding technical debt** and we acknowledge the availability of alternatives to frameworks, namely using dedicated libraries, standard libraries, programming languages and operating systems.

We believe that a framework, when chosen, should be used **responsibly** throughout the life of the project. Continuously remind yourself that **every tool has some kind of tradeoff**.

We also want to give the right weight to **technical decision-making** and in realizing that the choice to develop a project or a single feature with no dependence on a framework is a **real possibility**.

**With this movement we want to create awareness around these topics, gathering together people in a community.**

## Principles

Everytime that we consider the choice of a framework for a project we will use these principles to guide our choices.

* **The value of a software is not the code itself but in the reasons behind the existence of that code.**

* **Every decision should be made considering the context. A good choice in a given context could be a bad choice in another one.**

* **The mindful choice of a framework is a technical one and should be made by technical people, taking business needs into account.**

* **The decision-making criteria that led to the choice of a framework should be known to all the members in the team.**
